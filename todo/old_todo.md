* fix ancient sword/match not appearing

* put try/catch around log close
> ice hitboxes
> I also got NPC Party in-game but not on steam
> Also the hat fashion achievement says 29/29 but don't have the fez unlocked yet.
> rendering stuff is still weird (some option is off)
* snail active item in the hub debuffs you (you arent supposed to be able to use active items in the hub)
* check gold dagger
* If you got 99 bombs and bombshell, you can't pick up more to refill the bomb hp.
* make enemies in the room invincible while the player is not inside
* game doesnt save contantly? why does progress reset after crashes? (it looks like just the hub doesnt save)
* bk still can become idle
* bomb shell makes hp diplay wrong
* items in chasms should dissappear
* I was on the final boss and i noticed the boss door was unlocked deering the fight so i walked through it and this happened
* invis items back

#

* check why steam cloud doesnt download anything
* controller aim asist
* twitch integration cant be turned on (on pressing interact after pog it exits)
> Would be neat to have random items when using the shortcuts to give some fighting chance. Another use for emeralds like you pay 100 to start the floor with a random amount of treasure room items based on RNG and the shortcut used.
* maanex mob spawns suggestion
