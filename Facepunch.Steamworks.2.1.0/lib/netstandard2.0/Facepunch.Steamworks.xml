             We are trying to establish whether peers can talk to each other,
             whether they WANT to talk to each other, perform basic auth,
             and exchange crypt keys.
            
             - For connections on the "client" side (initiated locally):
               We're in the process of trying to establish a connection.
               Depending on the connection type, we might not know who they are.
               Note that it is not possible to tell if we are waiting on the
               network to complete handshake packets, or for the application layer
               to accept the connection.
            
             - For connections on the "server" side (accepted through listen socket):
               We have completed some basic handshake and the client has presented
               some proof of identity.  The connection is ready to be accepted
               using AcceptConnection().
            
             In either case, any unreliable packets sent now are almost certain
             to be dropped.  Attempts to receive packets are guaranteed to fail.
             You may send messages if the send mode allows for them to be queued.
             but if you close the connection before the connection is actually
             established, any queued messages will be discarded immediately.
             (We will not attempt to flush the queue and confirm delivery to the
             remote host, which ordinarily happens when a connection is closed.)
        </member>
        <member name="F:Steamworks.Data.ConnectionState.FindingRoute">
            Some connection types use a back channel or trusted 3rd party
            for earliest communication.  If the server accepts the connection,
            then these connections switch into the rendezvous state.  During this
            state, we still have not yet established an end-to-end route (through
            the relay network), and so if you send any messages unreliable, they
            are going to be discarded.
        </member>
        <member name="F:Steamworks.Data.ConnectionState.Connected">
            We've received communications from our peer (and we know
            who they are) and are all good.  If you close the connection now,
            we will make our best effort to flush out any reliable sent data that
            has not been acknowledged by the peer.  (But note that this happens
            from within the application process, so unlike a TCP connection, you are
            not totally handing it off to the operating system to deal with it.)
        </member>
        <member name="F:Steamworks.Data.ConnectionState.ClosedByPeer">
             Connection has been closed by our peer, but not closed locally.
             The connection still exists from an API perspective.  You must close the
             handle to free up resources.  If there are any messages in the inbound queue,
             you may retrieve them.  Otherwise, nothing may be done with the connection
             except to close it.
            
             This stats is similar to CLOSE_WAIT in the TCP state machine.

        <member name="F:Steamworks.Data.ConnectionState.ProblemDetectedLocally">
             A disruption in the connection has been detected locally.  (E.g. timeout,
             local internet connection disrupted, etc.)
            
             The connection still exists from an API perspective.  You must close the
             handle to free up resources.
            
             Attempts to send further messages will fail.  Any remaining received messages
             in the queue are available.

        <member name="F:Steamworks.Data.ConnectionState.FinWait">
            We've disconnected on our side, and from an API perspective the connection is closed.
            No more data may be sent or received.  All reliable data has been flushed, or else
            we've given up and discarded it.  We do not yet know for sure that the peer knows
            the connection has been closed, however, so we're just hanging around so that if we do
            get a packet from them, we can send them the appropriate packets so that they can
            know why the connection was closed (and not have to rely on a timeout, which makes
            it appear as if something is wrong).
        </member>
        <member name="F:Steamworks.Data.ConnectionState.Linger">
             We've disconnected on our side, and from an API perspective the connection is closed.
             No more data may be sent or received.  From a network perspective, however, on the wire,
             we have not yet given any indication to the peer that the connection is closed.
             We are in the process of flushing out the last bit of reliable data.  Once that is done,
             we will inform the peer that the connection has been closed, and transition to the
             FinWait state.
            
             Note that no indication is given to the remote host that we have closed the connection,
             until the data has been flushed.  If the remote host attempts to send us data, we will
             do whatever is necessary to keep the connection alive until it can be closed properly.
             But in fact the data will be discarded, since there is no way for the application to
             read it back.  Typically this is not a problem, as application protocols that utilize
             the lingering functionality are designed for the remote host to wait for the response
             before sending any more data.

             Send the message unreliably. Can be lost.  Messages *can* be larger than a
             single MTU (UDP packet), but there is no retransmission, so if any piece
             of the message is lost, the entire message will be dropped.
            
             The sending API does have some knowledge of the underlying connection, so
             if there is no NAT-traversal accomplished or there is a recognized adjustment
             happening on the connection, the packet will be batched until the connection
             is open again.

            that the message will NOT be sent immediately, in case further messages are
            sent soon after you send this, which can be grouped together.  Any time there
            is enough buffered data to fill a packet, the packets will be pushed out immediately,
            but partially-full packets not be sent until the Nagle timer expires.

             Object that describes a "location" on the Internet with sufficient
             detail that we can reasonably estimate an upper bound on the ping between
             the two hosts, even if a direct route between the hosts is not possible,
             and the connection must be routed through the Steam Datagram Relay network.
             This does not contain any information that identifies the host.  Indeed,
             if two hosts are in the same building or otherwise have nearly identical
             networking characteristics, then it's valid to use the same location
             object for both of them.
            
             NOTE: This object should only be used in the same process!  Do not serialize it,
             send it over the wire, or persist it in a file or database!  If you need
             to do that, convert it to a string representation using the methods in
             ISteamNetworkingUtils().

        <member name="M:Steamworks.Data.PingLocation.EstimatePingTo(Steamworks.Data.PingLocation)">
             Estimate the round-trip latency between two arbitrary locations, in
             milliseconds.  This is a conservative estimate, based on routing through
             the relay network.  For most basic relayed connections, this ping time
             will be pretty accurate, since it will be based on the route likely to
             be actually used.
            
             If a direct IP route is used (perhaps via NAT traversal), then the route
             will be different, and the ping time might be better.  Or it might actually
             be a bit worse!  Standard IP routing is frequently suboptimal!
            
             But even in this case, the estimate obtained using this method is a
             reasonable upper bound on the ping time.  (Also it has the advantage
             of returning immediately and not sending any packets.)
            
             In a few cases we might not able to estimate the route.  In this case
             a negative value is returned.  k_nSteamNetworkingPing_Failed means
             the reason was because of some networking difficulty.  (Failure to
             ping, etc)  k_nSteamNetworkingPing_Unknown is returned if we cannot
             currently answer the question for some other reason.
            
             Do you need to be able to do this from a backend/matchmaking server?

            Checks if your executable was launched through Steam and relaunches it through Steam if it wasn't
             this returns true then it starts the Steam client if required and launches your game again through it, 
             and you should quit your process as soon as possible. This effectively runs steam://run/AppId so it 
             may not relaunch the exact executable that called it, as it will always relaunch from the version 
             installed in your Steam library folder/
             Note that during development, when not launching via Steam, this might always return true.

            expiration( one hour ), but also because one of the items in the result set may 
            have been traded or consumed since the result set was generated.You could compare 
            the timestamp from GetResultTimestamp to ISteamUtils::GetServerRealTime to determine
            how old the data is. You could simply ignore the "expired" result code and

            an updated result set.
            You should call CheckResultSteamID on the result handle when it completes to verify 
            that a remote player is not pretending to have a different user's inventory.

            <summary>
            Asynchronously request the user's current stats and achievements from the server.
            You must always call this first to get the initial status of stats and achievements.
            Only after the resulting callback comes back can you start calling the rest of the stats 
            and achievement functions for the current user.

            Gets a leaderboard by name, it will create it if it's not yet created.
            Leaderboards created with this function will not automatically show up in the Steam Community.
            You must manually set the Community Name field in the App Admin panel of the Steamworks website. 
            As such it's generally recommended to prefer creating the leaderboards in the App Admin panel on 
            the Steamworks website and using FindLeaderboard unless you're expected to have a large amount of
            dynamically created leaderboards.

             Normally this call is unneeded if your game has a constantly running frame loop that calls the 
             D3D Present API, or OGL SwapBuffers API every frame.
            
             However, if you have a game that only refreshes the screen on an event driven basis then that can break 
             the overlay, as it uses your Present/SwapBuffers calls to drive it's internal frame loop and it may also
             need to Present() to the screen any time an even needing a notification happens or when the overlay is
             brought up over the game by a user.  You can use this API to ask the overlay if it currently need a present
             in that case, and then you can check for this periodically (roughly 33hz is desirable) and make sure you
             refresh the screen with Present or SwapBuffers to allow the overlay to do it's work.

            a high-friction UI confirmation process is highly recommended.ConsumeItem can be restricted to certain item definitions or fully
            blocked via the Steamworks website to minimize support/abuse issues such as the classic "my brother borrowed my laptop and deleted all of my rare items".

            <summary>
            Serialized result sets contain a short signature which can't be forged or replayed across different game sessions.
            A result set can be serialized on the local client, transmitted to other players via your game networking, and 
            deserialized by the remote players.This is a secure way of preventing hackers from lying about posessing 
            rare/high-value items. Serializes a result set with signature bytes to an output buffer.The size of a serialized 
            result depends on the number items which are being serialized.When securely transmitting items to other players, 
            it is recommended to use GetItemsByID first to create a minimal result set.
            Results have a built-in timestamp which will be considered "expired" after an hour has elapsed.See DeserializeResult
            for expiration handling.

            server updater.
